QuietDown
---------
This is my final project for TJ's Mobile App Development, created with Anna Klaussen in June 2015.

When the app is in range of an estimote beacon it disables the ringer, re-enabling all settings when you leave the region with the beacon. This could be used in movie theaters, meeting rooms, classrooms, and more, to ensure that your phone automatically silences itself in those locations.
